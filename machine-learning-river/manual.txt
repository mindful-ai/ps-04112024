The river module in machine learning is a library specifically designed for 
online machine learning or streaming data. It provides tools for working with 
data that is generated or arrives in streams, such as real-time data processing, 
where the model is updated incrementally as new data points arrive. Unlike traditional 
machine learning libraries, which require the entire dataset to be loaded in memory, 
river works by updating the model incrementally, one data point at a time, which makes 
it efficient for handling large or infinite datasets.

Key Features of river:

Incremental Learning: Allows you to update models as new data arrives, without the 
need to retrain from scratch.

Streaming Algorithms: Provides algorithms that can process data streams in real-time.

Easy to Use: Designed with a similar API to scikit-learn, making it easier to 
integrate into existing workflows.
