The creme module is a Python library for online machine learning 
(also known as incremental learning), designed to allow models to learn from data 
that arrives sequentially, one sample at a time. This is especially useful when 
working with large datasets or streaming data where the entire dataset cannot be 
loaded into memory at once. Unlike traditional machine learning, where models are 
trained in batches, online learning updates the model incrementally as new data 
becomes available.

Key features of creme include:

It supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms 
(classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
It can handle data streams and make predictions in real-time.
It integrates with scikit-learn, meaning you can use creme models with 
scikit-learn pipelines and other tools.

Why use creme for a machine learning task?
Memory Efficiency: Since the model learns incrementally, it doesn't need to store the 
entire dataset in memory. This is ideal for large datasets or data streams where storing a
ll past data isn't feasible.
Real-Time Predictions: As the model is trained on each new data point, predictions 
can be made in real-time, making this useful for applications like fraud detection, 
recommendation systems, and sensor data analysis.
Online Learning: creme is specifically designed for online learning, where the model's 
performance can be evaluated continuously as it adapts to new data.
